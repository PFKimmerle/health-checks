# Health Check Scripts Repository

This repository contains a set of Python scripts designed to perform various health checks on a system. Each script is targeted at monitoring specific aspects of system health to ensure optimal operation within desired parameters.

## Overview

These health check scripts are part of a broader initiative to provide robust tools for system monitoring. Each script can be deployed independently or integrated into a larger monitoring framework.

## Scripts

- **Disk Usage Check (`disk_check_usage.py`)**: Monitors disk space to prevent thresholds from being exceeded.
- **CPU Usage Check (`cpu_usage_check.py`)**: Ensures CPU usage remains below a specified threshold.
- **Memory Usage Check (`memory_usage_check.py`)**: Checks that memory usage does not exceed predefined limits.
- **Network Connectivity Check (`network_connectivity_check.py`)**: Tests the ability to connect to a network via specific hostname and port.
- **System Uptime Check (`system_uptime_check.py`)**: Verifies that system uptime meets or exceeds minimum expectations.
- **Service Status Check (`service_status_check.py`)**: Confirms that essential services are actively running.
- **Temperature Check (`temperature_check.py`)**: Monitors CPU/system temperature to avoid overheating.
- **Log File Error Check (`log_error_check.py`)**: Scans log files for specific error patterns to identify potential issues early.

## Getting Started

To use these scripts, ensure Python is installed on your system. You can run each script individually using Python.
